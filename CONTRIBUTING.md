# Contributing to ESP-IDF-CXX

Contributions to ESP-IDF-CXX - fixing bugs, adding features, adding documentation - are welcome! We accept contributions via Github Pull Requests.

Currently, we use the same contribution guidelines as ESP-IDF itself as basis. Please see the [ESP-IDF Contributions Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/contribute/index.html) for more information. However, the workflow is quite simplified, we only use github for collaboration. Furthermore, we use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for commits.

Please also consider the legal part: You will be required to sign the [Contributor Agreement](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/contribute/contributor-agreement.html) for any Pull Request.
